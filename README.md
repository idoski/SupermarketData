# SupermarketInventorySystem


Simple supermarket inventory management system.
Inspired by my friends and I playing Supermarket Together

Create an account with just a username and password on your local machine
Add days to the main screen and add items to your days to track what you have sold/bought.

9/6/24
Currently only login system works, you can create and account and "login" as it
but beyond that nothing else happens. Working on the actual interface.
